This is based on a tutorial from egghead.
Tried to use best practices with linting, testing, styling and components.

Added several other things to the project.

- `eslint` with `prettier`
- `husky` and `lint-staged`
- `react-testing-library` and `jest`
- `next/jest` experimental features and coverage in Codecov.
- Build and Test with `Github actions`.
- Deployed to `Vercel`.
